# Otter-Mobile

Hey!

This is an app I've made to try out the Flutter framework.
I haven't done anything for mobile devices before, so I thought I'd give it a shot.

This repo only has the source code in it, not the Flutter project, so if you would want to run that yourself, you need to create a new Flutter project and copy my code into it.

Only ever built for Android, since I don't own an Apple Device.

The code is a heavily modified version of a project I did for a one-day course on mobile apps.

Feel free to download the apk if you want:
