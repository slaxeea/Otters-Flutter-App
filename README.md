# Otter-Mobile
 
Hey!

This is an app I've made to try out the Flutter framework.
I haven't done anything for mobile devices before, so I thought I'd give it a shot.

Only ever built for Android, since I don't own an Apple Device.

The code is a modified version of a project I did for a one-day course on mobile apps.
It was about an app that displayed a list of recipes, which you could look up the ingredients for.

So what I did was:
- Copy the .JSON from the Otter-Website repo and modify it, so that the otters are in an array instead of an object
- Change the file-reader class to read the new properties of an otter instead of a recipe
- Modify the way objects are rendered, since you cannot render a otter the same way as a recipe :) 
- Deleted the recipe class and changed it for a otter class (makes sense, right?)
- Download the favicon and make it readable as an app-icon for android devices
- Other stuff I've forgotten
